## Prologue

The target of the project was to get better understanding of the algorithms and codes described in the article published on https://www.kdnuggets.com/customer-segmentation-in-python-a-practical-approach website.

## Project description

RFM analysis provides a structured framework for evaluating customer behavior, while K-means clustering offers a data-driven approach to group customers into meaningful segments.

It is possible to gain insights into customer behavior and preferences, by applying RFM analysis and K-means clustering to dataset.

RFM Analysis is a simple yet powerful method to quantify customer behavior. It evaluates customers based on three key dimensions:

Recency (R): How recently did a particular customer make a purchase?

Frequency (F): How often do they make purchases?

Monetary Value (M): How much money do they spend?

The information in dataset is used to compute the recency, frequency, and monetary values. Generally used RFM score scale is 1-5
